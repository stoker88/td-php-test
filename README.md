# PHP Lumen Test

This is a PHP test that will help show your knowledge with creating APIs and dealing with videos.

# The Task

Your task is to create a simple API application using the Lumen Framework. The API should have a single endpoint, but should be written with future endpoints in mind. 

The endpoint you must implement should do as follows: 

1. Only accept ``POST`` requests.
2. Be versioned (How you version the API is up to you).
3. Recieve a video file (via multipart/form-data), which should be saved locally. 
4. Use ``getID3`` to process the ``video`` file.
5. Return the analyzed data from ``getID3`` as JSON.

# Considerations

When writing your application, you should consider the following.

1. Make sure you are following the SOLID principles.
2. Make sure your following styling standards like PSR-2.
3. Write tests using ``PHPUnit``.
4. Use TDD to help you write clean and testable code.

# Submitting

Once you have completed, you can submit it by creating a public repository on github (or a like) and provide us with a link.
